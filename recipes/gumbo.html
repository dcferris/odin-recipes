        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Gumbo is a rich, flavorful stew rooted in Louisiana's Creole and Cajun culinary traditions. It typically features a dark roux as the base, combined with the "holy trinity" of vegetables, onion, celery, and bell pepper, and loaded with meats such as chicken, Andouille sausage, and shrimp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gumbo is often thickened with okra or file powder. Bold spices, herbs like thyme and bay leaf, and a splash of hot sauce create a deeply savory, slightly spicy dish that's both hearty and a comforting, soulful expression of Louisiana's diverse cultural heritage.

            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
            <li>1-2 cups sliced okra, or 1 tablespoon file powder</li>
            <li>1 lb Andouille sausage, sliced</li>
            <li>1 lb boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 lb raw shrimp</li>
            <li>6 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Cajun or Creole seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Louisiana hot sauce, to taste (Crystal, Tabasco, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the roux. </strong>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and gradually whisk it, stirring constantly. Cook the roux for 20-30 minutes, stirring frequently, until it becomes a deep brown color, like chocolate. Be patient and don't stop stirring, or it may burn.</li>
            <li><strong>Saute the vegetables. </strong>Once the roux reaches the right color, add the onion, bell pepper, and celery to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables soften. Then add the garlic and saute for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the meats. </strong>Stir in the sliced sausage and diced chicken, cooking until the chicekn is lightly browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Add stock and seasonings. </strong>Pour in 6 cups of chicken stock and stir well, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Add the bay leaves, thyme, Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add shrimp and thickeners. </strong>Add the shrimp and okra and simmer for another 10 minutes, or until the shrimp are cooked through.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve. </strong>Ladle the gumbo over white rice. Enjoy!</li>
